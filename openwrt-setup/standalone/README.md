# Openwalla Standalone OpenWrt Installers

These scripts install individual Openwalla router helpers. The main installer at `openwrt-setup/setup-openwrt-router.sh` is a dispatcher that downloads and runs these feature bundles.

Use the dispatcher when you want a simple feature command:

```sh
sh openwrt-setup/setup-openwrt-router.sh netify
sh openwrt-setup/setup-openwrt-router.sh conntrack
sh openwrt-setup/setup-openwrt-router.sh device-speed
sh openwrt-setup/setup-openwrt-router.sh network-monitor dns speedtest
sh openwrt-setup/setup-openwrt-router.sh stack --with-netify
```

Run them from the repository root or from this folder on the router:

```sh
sh openwrt-setup/standalone/install-netify.sh
```

For low-space routers, the mobile app downloads only the selected installer
scripts and `standalone/lib/openwalla-standalone-common.sh` into `/tmp`. The
shared helper fetches each required file from `openwrt-setup/files/` with
`wget` or `curl` only when that installer needs it.

Available installers:

- `install-standard-apps.sh` - uhttpd-mod-ubus, nlbwmon, vnstat2, sqlite, conntrack, and qrencode

Each installer keeps existing `/etc/config/openwalla` if present, installs the needed worker/init files, applies only that feature's UCI defaults, installs the shared rpcd ACL, and starts/enables only the relevant service.
